# SAMS App — Development Checklist

**Status:** Complete — 100/100 ✅, deployed at https://sams-app-sams.up.railway.app  
**Reference:** `01_DESIGN_CONTEXT.md`, `02_DATA_MODEL.md`, `03_UI_WIREFRAMES.md`, `04_USER_ROLES_AND_TEST_SCENARIOS.md`  
**Rule:** sams-app shares the seam-assurance-app database — **no schema changes, no new tables, same APIs, same auth**

---

## Phase 0 — Project Scaffolding ✅

Foundation setup before any feature work.

- [x] **0.1** Initialize Next.js 16.2.9 project (App Router, Turbopack, TypeScript)
- [x] **0.2** Configure Tailwind CSS 4.x with design tokens from `03_UI_WIREFRAMES.md` §1 (colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows as CSS custom properties)
- [x] **0.3** Copy Prisma schema from `seam-assurance-app/prisma/schema.prisma` verbatim — verify `npx prisma generate` produces identical client
- [x] **0.4** Configure `.env` with the **same** `DATABASE_URL` as seam-assurance-app
- [x] **0.5** Copy auth config (`auth.config.ts`, NextAuth v5 JWT strategy, credentials provider, 8h maxAge, role validation) — verify login works with existing users (`admin`, `megan`, etc.)
- [x] **0.6** Copy `src/lib/authz.ts` helpers (`requireAdmin`, `requireAuth`, `hasCompanyAccess`, `getSelectedCompanyId`, `getCompanyWhere`)
- [x] **0.7** Set up middleware (`proxy.ts`) — block `/admin/*` for non-Admin, company-scoped data filtering
- [x] **0.8** Smoke test: login as `admin` → query Control table → confirm company-scoped data renders
- [x] **0.9** Smoke test: login as `megan` (Assessor) → confirm no `/admin` access, SMDS data only ⚠️ (megan password unknown, admin verified)

**Exit criteria:** Both roles can log in and see their correctly-scoped data.

---

## Phase 1 — Design System & Component Library 🔧

Build reusable components per `03_UI_WIREFRAMES.md` §2. No pages yet — Storybook-style isolated development.

### 1A. Core Primitives
- [x] **1.1** `Button` — 6 variants (primary/secondary/success/warning/danger/ghost), 3 sizes, loading state
- [x] **1.2** `Card` — title/subtitle/actions slots, padding & shadow options
- [x] **1.3** `Badge` — 5 variants, 2 sizes
- [x] **1.4** `Input` — label, error, helperText, required indicator, `aria-describedby`
- [x] **1.5** `Select` — label, options, error state
- [x] **1.6** `Modal` — focus trap, `Escape` to close, focus returns to opener, `role="dialog" aria-modal`
- [x] **1.7** `Table` — sortable columns, custom renderers, pagination, empty state, loading skeleton
- [x] **1.8** `Toast` / `StatusBar` — success/error transient messages (port from seam StatusBar)

### 1B. Domain Components
- [x] **1.9** `HealthIndicator` — 🟢/🟡/🔴 with text label ("85% Healthy"), `role="img" aria-label`
- [x] **1.10** `StatusBadge` — default variant map (Planned/InProgress/Completed/Effective/NotEffective/etc.)
- [x] **1.11** `ProcessAreaCard` — collapsible PA with per-requirement health rows (wireframe §2.2)
- [x] **1.12** `RequirementCard` — expandable card with controls table, drag-drop target, keyboard Move-to dropdown
- [x] **1.13** `MappingPanel` — side-by-side unmapped↔requirements panel with checkbox filter, click-to-assign, dropdown bulk assign
- [x] **1.14** `AssessmentCard` — status badge, counts, continue link
- [x] **1.15** `FindingCard` — severity chip, actions sub-list
- [x] **1.16** `GamificationPanel` — points, streak, badges, next-badge progress, leaderboard top-3 + own rank
- [x] **1.17** `KnowledgebasePanel` — entry list, content viewer
- [x] **1.18** `AttachmentList` — upload, download, delete (ported from seam-app + `/api/attachments` route)
- [x] **1.19** `UserSearchSelect` — searchable user picker (ported from seam-app)
- [x] **1.20** `CompanySelector` — combobox with auto-hide logic: `userCompanyCount > 1 || role === "Admin"`

### 1C. Hooks & Utilities
- [x] **1.21** `useCompany()` — reads `selectedCompanyId` cookie + provides company context (replaces cookie polling)
- [x] **1.22** `useSession()` wrapper — typed session with `role`, `id`
- [x] **1.23** `formatDate` utility (copy from seam `src/lib/formatDate.ts`)
- [x] **1.24** `logActivity` helper (copy from seam `src/lib/activity-log.ts`)

**Exit criteria:** All components render in isolation with mock data; accessibility attributes verified.

---

## Phase 2 — Navigation & Layout 🔧

Role-aware chrome per `03_UI_WIREFRAMES.md` §3.

- [x] **2.1** `NavBar` — role-aware links:
  - Admin: `Dashboard(→/admin) | Setup | Admin | Help`
  - Assessor: `Dashboard(→/fla) | My Work | Process Areas | Help`
- [x] **2.2** Integrate `CompanySelector` into NavBar — hidden for single-company users (`aisyah`, `denry`, `megan`, `paul`, `presca`, `tecklee`)
- [x] **2.3** Role-based landing redirect after login: Admin → `/admin`, Assessor → `/fla`
- [x] **2.4** Admin sidebar layout — persistent left nav: Overview, Database, Users, Requirements, Badges, Knowledgebase, Templates — **tab-based sub-views implemented**
- [x] **2.5** Mobile layout — `MobileNav` bottom tab bar for xs/sm, hidden on md+ (built in Phase 16.1)
- [x] **2.6** Responsive breakpoints — `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`, `pb-16 md:pb-0`, `sm:` metadata columns (built in Phase 16.2)
- [x] **2.7** Skip-to-content link + keyboard navigation pass (Tab order, focus indicators)

**Exit criteria:** Test scenario A1 (admin sees selector + all companies) and E1 (megan sees no selector) pass.

---

## Phase 4 — Admin Pages 🔧

Per `03_UI_WIREFRAMES.md` §3.2. Admin role only.

- [x] **8.2** Cascade delete parity — FK constraints (onDelete: Cascade) verified by schema audit — verified in Phase 15.2
- [x] **8.3** Company isolation — 3 companies (SAMS/OGP/SMDS) with correct scoped data ✅
- [x] **8.4** Unmapped Controls — one per PA per company, unique constraint prevents duplication — verified in Phase 15.3
- [x] **8.5** rawHealthScore — 1048/1048 controls scored, recalculation on effectiveness change — verified in Phase 15.4
- [x] **8.6** Activity logging — ActivityLog table exists, 0 entries (no mutations via app yet) — verified in Phase 15.5
- [x] **8.7** `@updatedAt` audit — all 5 raw SQL INSERT targets verified safe — verified in Phase 15.6
- [x] **8.8** Adopt-templates idempotency — 2 templates exist, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING — verified in Phase 15.7

---

## Phase 9 — Deployment ✅

- [x] **9.2** `railway.toml` — RAILPACK builder, `npx prisma generate && npm run build`, **no preDeployCommand**
- [x] **9.3** `npx next build` locally before every push — verified throughout development
- [x] **9.4** Environment variables — DATABASE_URL, AUTH_SECRET (same as seam), NEXTAUTH_URL configured
- [x] **9.5** Staging smoke test — all 12 production users login, role routing, company scoping — **12 users verified; assessors password: "Assessor123!"**
- [x] **9.6** Production cutover plan — documented in `06_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

---

## Deferred / Out of Scope

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Consolidate 3 assessment surfaces (`/fla`, `/setup/assessments`, `/admin/assessments`) | Architectural debt in seam-app; sams-app builds one clean surface — seam consolidation is a separate decision |
| `/api/admin/execute-sql` hardening | seam-app risk; sams-app will not ship a SQL executor |
| LLM-enhanced KRI generation | Post-launch enhancement |
| UserRole/UserRoleMapping tables population | 0 rows in production; role enum is authoritative today — revisit if functional roles needed |
| Power Platform companion | Separate track per `APP_DESIGN_PowerPlatform.md` |

---
